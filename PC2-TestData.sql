These households pay a much higher proportion of their incomes for their home heating needs. As a result, they are at risk of losing access to heat during cold-weather months. The program is designed to help these families keep their heat on, especially those households that are most vulnerable, such as the elderly, the disabled, and households with young children. LIHEAP primarily assists households by applying an energy assistance grant directly to the energy provider on behalf of the eligible household. In some situations, LIHEAP may also be able to help repair or replace an unsafe, dysfunctional, and/or inoperative heating system. Households who are eligible for LIHEAP may also qualify to have their homes made more energy efficient through the Weatherization Program.')

As a school we strive to create evidence based practitioners through an education that is grounded in theoretical and contemporary knowledge and that engages students through immersive, experiential learning experiences. The school is comprised of two strong departments, Education and Kinesiology. Education at PLU is defined by rigorous academics coupled with early and on-going field experiences. It includes both undergraduate and graduate degree programs that can lead to initial teaching certification. As a department, Education seeks interactive, collaborative partnerships between students, teachers, administrators, parents, and the business and social community as it strives to provide the most relevant and meaningful programming possible. In addition, the department is committed to lifelong learning for alumni and all educators through offerings in the partnership and professional development program. Kinesiology programs are designed to provide quality academic professional preparation for undergraduate students in areas related to the study of human movement, especially as it supports the pursuit of lifelong physical activity and well-being. Specifically, Kinesiology offers programs in health & fitness education, recreation, exercise science, pre-physical therapy, pre-athletic training and health & fitness promotion. These programs serve to prepare future leaders who will positively impact the health behaviors of individuals and of society through the education and promotion of life-sustaining and life-enhancing pursuits. If you are interested in joining a dynamic, engaged learning community with a focus on serving and leading others we encourage you to explore our web pages and reach out if you have any further questions.')
