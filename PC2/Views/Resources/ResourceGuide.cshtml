    <p>Dear Reader:</p>
    <br />
    <p>This Pierce County Resource Guide is dedicated to the hard work and commitment of those who have endeavored 
        timelessly over the years to “keep the promise.”</p>
    <br />
    <p>We want to acknowledge the generous support of Pierce County Human Services, Developmental Disabilities 
        Program, in providing the funds to update and print this important comprehensive guide to services and supports 
        for individuals who experience intellectual/ developmental disabilities.  This important tool will assist you in 
        navigating the public and private programs and services available throughout Pierce County and beyond. </p>
    <br />
    <p>The Pierce County Coalition for Developmental Disabilities (PC2) welcomes the opportunity to assist individuals 
        and families in finding the services and programs that best meet your needs. We are here to answer your calls 
        if you need further assistance.  Whether you are an individual who experiences an intellectual/developmental 
        disability, have a family member who experiences an intellectual/developmental disability, work within the disability 
        field, or are in the general community, we welcome your questions and concerns. </p>
    <br />
    <p>We acknowledge that, when compiling this complex list of resources, there are changes that can occur during the 
        production process.  Please know that every effort was made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of agency
